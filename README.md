Search keyword in files
==
**Task**: implement a program for searching files by keywords. The program gets the path to the search directory and a list of keywords of any length, e.g.:
`./main ./search/ flag apple ` and outputs the paths to files containing any of these words.

**Note**: It`s forbidden to read entire files to memory. This program searches regardless of the case of letters.
